AIN	Analog input pin.
+3.3V	Connection to the +3.3V power net.
+5V	Connection to the +5V power net.
GND	Connection the power ground net.
LCD	An LCD signal pin.
GPIO	A general-purpose digital input/output pin, operating at 3.3 Volts.
(G)	In addition to another functionality, a pin that is also usable as a GPIO.
(OPT)	A socket type that is optionally supported by a mainboard or a module.
[UN]	Modules must not connect to this pin if using this socket type. Mainboards can support multiple socket types on one socket, as long as individual pin functionalities overlap in a compatible manner, so that a pin from one socket type can overlap with a [UN] pin of another.
!	Interrupt-capable and software pull-up capable GPIO (the pull-up is switchable and in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 ohms).

Socket Type A

Three analog inputs, with pins number 3 and 4 doubling as general-purpose input/output. In addition, pin number 6 is a general-purpose input/output, and pin number 3 supports interrupt capabilities.

Socket Type B
Display (LCD) interface, carrying the blue component on pins 3 to 7, as well as the LCD enable line on pin 8 and the clock signal on pin 9.


Socket Type I
I2C interface. Pins 8 and 9 are the dedicated I2C data (SDA) and clock (SCL) lines. Note that a mainboard should include pull-up resistors for these pins, in the region of 2.2K Ohms. Modules must not include their own pull-ups on these lines. In addition, pins 3 and 6 are general-purpose input/outputs, with pin 3 supporting interrupt capabilities.


Socket Type P
Three pulse-with modulated (PWM) outputs on pins 7, 8 and 9. Pins 7 and 9 double as GPIOs. In addition, pin 3 is an interrupt-capable GPIO, and pin 6 is a GPIO.

Socket Type Y
Seven general-purpose input/output pins, with pin number 3 supporting interrupt capabilities.
